Week 1: Running an Analysis of Variance
In this task, I am analyzing the variance of internetuserate, a quantitative variable, against polityscore, a categorical score. Because polityscore was measured with 21 bins, I have adjusted the values to fall within 3 bins, low, med, and high, because the sample size is small and I want each bin to have a greater number of samples for more accurate statistics. I then performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA).

import pandas as pd

import statsmodels.stats.multicomp as multi

data = pd.read_csv('c:/Users/Greg/Desktop/gapminder.csv', low_memory=False)
Set the variables to numeric and sort Polity Score into three bins

data['internetuserate'] = pd.to_numeric(data['internetuserate'], errors='coerce')
data['polityscore'] = pd.to_numeric(data['polityscore'], errors='coerce')

sub1 = data.copy()

sub3 = sub1[['internetuserate', 'polityscore']].dropna()
sub3['polityscore_binned'] = pd.cut(sub3.polityscore, 3, labels=['Low', 'Med', 'High'])
Use the ols function for calculating the F-statistic and associated p value

model1 = smf.ols(formula='internetuserate ~ C(polityscore_binned)', data=sub3)
results1 = model1.fit()
results1.summary()

Standard deviations for internetuserate by polity score

Results show that there is a significant correlation between a country’s internet use rate and its polity score. Countries with a Low polity score have more internet use (mean=27.38, sd=±22.58) than countries with Med polity scores (mean=12.02, sd=±15.34), but not as much as countries with High polity scores (mean=39.79, sd=±28.28). (F-statistic = 13.68, p = 0.00000345).
